#Quite Simple Publishing System

This is a single-author email-based content management system. It's as simple as
it can be.

Status: **pre-alpha**

### Motivation:

Sometimes you just want to get your content live, and that's it. No bulky
installs, no themes or plugins to choose from. As simple as it can be.

I also didn't want to have to login in order to post something. So you have to
sign your content instead. QSPS will check for a valid sgnature and act
accordingly.


So if you have an email address, a PGP key and a desire for simplicity, go ahead
and give this one a try.

### Features:

* Email-based
* Plain-file index (no database)
* Single-user (currently)

**What QSPS is:** The simplest, most down-to-earth blog engine you'll find, with
a special appeal to crypto-geeks.

**What QSPS is not:** A Wordpress/Joomla/etc. replacement. It's not a _content
management system_. it won't give you a pretty editor or a login panel, or a
fancy administration page.
