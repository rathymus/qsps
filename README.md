#QSPS

Quite Simple Publishing System

This is a single-author email-based content management system. It's as simple as it can be.


##1. Motivation:

Sometimes you just want to get your content live, and that's it. No bulky installs, no themes
or plugins to choose from. As simple as it can be.

I also didn't want to have to login in order to post something. So you have to sign your content
instead. QSPS will check for a valid sgnature and act accordingly.

**What QSPS is:** The simplest, down

##2. Features:

* Email-based
* Plain-file index (no database)
* Single-user (currently)
* Fire-And-Forget

##3. Future Improvements


* Multi-user support  
    QSPS lacks multi-user support. That's because in my blog I'm the only one who's publishing any content, therefore
    I had no need to support multiple authors. This may not suit other users.
* Content access protection  
    At the moment all content is public. Introduce a groups-based (or other) policy to allow priviledged publishing.
